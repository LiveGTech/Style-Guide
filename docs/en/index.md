# The LiveG Style Guide
Welcome to The LiveG Style Guide, a handbook that specifies formatting recommendations for both written communications and code to ensure that both are standardised across the LiveG brand and organisation.

## Why conform to the style guide?
By conforming to the style guide, you help to uphold LiveG's standard for high-quality output that it is known for. It ensures consistency across everything that we publish, which is important for us to deliver clear messages to our end users.

## When should I conform to the style guide?
You should conform to the style guide when you are:

* Writing an official statement or announcement on behalf of LiveG (such as on social media or on our blog)
* Writing code or documentation that is part of a LiveG project
* Sending public or private correspondence through a LiveG staff email address (@liveg.tech)

You don't have to conform to the style guide when you are:

* Writing messages or discussing details through written communications in a way that is not on behalf of LiveG (such as on Discord)
* Writing code or documentation that is unrelated to LiveG, or is not officially owned by LiveG (for example, when you're creating an app by using LiveG's tools and libraries, but on your own personal GitHub account)
* Communicating internally with other LiveG staff members (however, it is recommended that you conform to the style guide when communicating with those who are not LiveG staff members; for example, external contributors to LiveG projects)
